My research focuses on evaluating and developing methods of [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) to detect, quantify and mitigate biases within Vision-Language Models.

I am in my first year of PhD, supervised by [Radu Timofte](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u3MwH5kAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [JMU Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/), working closely with the [Media Bias Group](https://media-bias-research.org/) in-person at NII Tokyo, invited here by [Prof. Echizen-sensei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RduUnVIAAAAJ&hl=en).

I've extensive teaching experience - taught [Computer Architectures](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/en/education/bk/predmety/43/58/p4358606.html) course at the [CTU Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) university, taught robotics course at a [Grammar School](https://kavalirka.cz/), years of high-school [robotic workshops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HozAWvxzg9w) teaching for the [National Library of Technology in Prague](https://www.techlib.cz/en/), years of teaching preparatory programming [Bootcamp](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/b242/courses/pri-bootcamp/start) for newly admitted students at the [FEE CTU](https://fel.cvut.cz/en). I have also worked as a research fellow in various labs since my first year of studies and after my first year I've delivered a [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31-o4e0SBZQ) about my first project.
